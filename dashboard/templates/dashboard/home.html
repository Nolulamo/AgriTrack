        <h4 class="text-center">About AgriTrack</h4>
            <p>Soil fertility is the ability of soil to sustain plant growth and optimize crop yield. The soil is considered infertile if there is deficiency or overdose of nutrients available for plant growth. Both less and over- fertilization can lead to sudden plant growth with an insufficient root system to supply adequate water and nutrients to crops. Poor root structure reduces the number of flowers and fruit production, and can result in plant growth spurts that won't be supported or sustained. This reduces crop yield and hence the need to monitor and control the nutrients available for crop growth. AgriTrack is here to help you with that</p>
        <h4 class="text-center">How will AgriTrack help you</h4>
            <p>AgriTrack can greatly benefit you by providing you with real-time data on the health and nutrient levels of your crops. This can help you make informed decisions about when and how much to irrigate and fertilize. With this system, you can optimize crop growth, reduce water and fertilizer waste. Additionally, remote monitoring allows you to keep track of your crops from anywhere, which can save you time and money spent traveling to and from your fields. Overall, this technology can help you improve your yields and profits while also promoting sustainable farming practices.</p>
